phpGrid 6

- enable_edit
Added a 3rd parameter for user defined edit script file name other than the default "edit.php" file. Note that the user defined edit file is NOT automatically passed to detail and subgrid. In most cases, you do not need to use your own edit script rather than simply modify edit.php (requires Enterprise or Universal license for source code).

- set_col_dynalink
now works with local array

- cls_database.php
db2-dsnless
Now supports DB2 DSN-less as database type. Thanks, Jon Paris!
odbc_mssql_native
"odbc_mssql_native" DB_TYPE for SQL Server Native ODBC driver
"odbc_mssql" should be used for ***DSN-only connectivity *** on *nix, OS X using unixODBC through FreeTDS.
unixODBC requires environment variables in conf.php
  putenv("ODBCINSTINI=/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.1/etc/odbcinst.ini");
  putenv("ODBCINI=/usr/local/Cellar/unixodbc/2.3.1/etc/odbc.ini");

unixODBC is DSN connection only with the following .conf and .ini files. I used Amazon RDS MSSQL instance during testing.

   /usr/local/Cellar/freetds/0.91/etc/freetds.conf

   # server specific section
    [global]
    # TDS protocol version
    ; tds version = 4.2

    # Whether to write a TDSDUMP file for diagnostic purposes
    # (setting this to /tmp is insecure on a multi-user system)
    ; dump file = /tmp/freetds.log
    ; debug flags = 0xffff

    # Command and connection timeouts

    # If you get out-of-memory errors, it may mean that your client
    # is trying to allocate a huge buffer for a TEXT field.
    # Try setting 'text size' to a more reasonable limit
    text size = 64512

- conf.php
Add "PHPGRID" to prefix all DB constant to avoid potential name collisons with other systems and frameworks. eg. Wordpress uses DB_NAME variable.

- SQL Server
The cells with NULL value repeat the value from the previous row has been fixed due to a bug in ADOdb (server/adodb5/adodb.inc.php), our database abstract class library.

- before_script_end public variable
Added public variable 'before_script_end'. It can be 'hooked' into the display when ALL the DOM elements are ready.

- cust_prop_jsonstr (known as ud_params pre-version six)
example: filter_grid_on_pageload.php
Not that it's NOT possible to use set_grid_property function for the particular filter example because the filters must be passed as string to data.php via POST for the filter to work. However, this example is significant because it's illustrates it is possible to persist search criteria even user navigates to another page and comes back to phpGrid.
Example:
$dg->cust_prop_jsonstr = 'toppager:true,';  // clone toolbar to top

- set_grid_property
Parameters:
$grid_property: An array represents grid property. The property will add to or overwrite existing properties already defined by phpGrid.
Description:
Advanced method. Set custom datagrid properties. The parameter must be an array. You must be rather familiar jqGrid API in order to take advantage of this method effectively. In most cases, you do not need to use this method. Note that this method is not the same as set_grid_method, another advanced phpGrid method.
Example:
$dg -> set_grid_property(array('search'=>true));

- set_grid_method
It now takes variable arguments. The changes make the function more flexible with different jqGrid methods with variable arguments. Super useful. :)

- INLINE edit improvement:
checkbox now display as checkbox,
new blank row when add.
auto refresh grid after add.
WYSIWYG support

- set_edit_condition
Set row-level edit condition for edition permission.
Note:
1. that this works for INLINE ONLY by hiding the edit icons using javascript, CSS
2. For that reason, developers should still validate user permission at the database or on the server side.
3. In more complicate condition, it's recommended to create your condition at run-time
Parameter:
     array(column => compare_operand, '&& OR ||', column2 => compare_operand, '&& OR ||'.....)
Usage example:
     $dg->enable_edit('INLINE', 'CRUD')->set_edit_condition(array('status'=>'!="Shipped"', '&&', 'customerNumber'=>'==129' ));
Example of generated javascript conditon:
     if $column = "status", $compare_operand = " == 'Shipped'", then it ouputs: if($("#orders").jqGrid("getCell", rowId, "status") == "Shipped"){

Example file: custom_edit_conditon.php

- Composite PK support (Enterprise+)
This is a major feature in version 6. Lots of development time devoted to support composite PK, and yet making it simple at the same time. In stead of passing a single string variable in the constructor as the primary key, you can now pass an array of strings as the composite primary key. For a single primary key, you can still use a string or an array with a single string value. e.g.

composite primary key:
$sdg = new C_DataGrid("SELECT * FROM orderdetails", array("productCode", "orderNumber"), "orderdetails");

single primary key
$dg = new C_DataGrid("SELECT * FROM orders", "orderNumber", "orders");
- OR -
$dg = new C_DataGrid("SELECT * FROM orders", array("orderNumber"), "orders");


Note that composite PK is not supported for foreign key referencial in master/detail and subgrid.

- set_col_edittype
Use index number 0 and 1 instead of column name to retrieve data value in "select" edit type. This allows more complex SQL statement such as CONCAT.

- Conditional format
Fixed bug in subgrid due to "+" column

- set_masterdetail
The 2rd parameter is finally working as intended. It no longer has to be the same name as the master primary key. It was never implemented.
